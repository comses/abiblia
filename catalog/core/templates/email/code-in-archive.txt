We are contacting you regarding your publication {{ publication_title | default: "" }}. As a part of CoMSES Net, a spoke in
the Big Data Network of the U.S. National Science Foundation, we focus on sharing and preserving primarily agent- and individual-based
computational models in our database of publications. This database connects scholars to allow them to find relevant model codes
and build on each other's work. As you may be aware, there is an increasing demand for the transparency and sharing of data and
model codes used for scientific publications (https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376).

Your publication was included in our database, and we suggest that you deposit the code in a public archive.

Thank you,

The CoMSES Network Editors
