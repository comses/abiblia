Dear {{ publication.contact_author_name|default:"CONTACT_AUTHOR_NAME" }},

We are contacting you regarding your publication {{ publication.title|default:"PUBLICATION_TITLE" }}. As a part of CoMSES Net, a spoke in the Big Data Network of the U.S. National Science Foundation, we focus on sharing and preserving primarily agent- and individual-based computational models in our database of publications. This database connects scholars to allow them to find relevant model codes and build on each other's work. As you may be aware, there is an increasing demand for the transparency and sharing of data and model codes used for scientific publications (https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376).

Your publication was included in our database and we were able to find your code in a public archive. Congratulations!
If you have any corrections to make to our metadata please contact us at (somewhere).

Thank you,

The CoMSES Network Editors
