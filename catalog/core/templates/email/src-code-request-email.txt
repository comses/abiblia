{% blocktrans %}Dear {{ author_name }},{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}
I contact you in regard to your publication “ {{ publication_title }}“. I am part of CoMSES Net, a Spoke in the Big Data Network of the US
National Science Foundation, and we focus on sharing and preserving computational models. As part of this we develop
a database of publications on computational models (mainly agent-based and individual-based). This database will allow
scholars to find relevant model code and makes it easier to build on each other’s work. As you may be aware there is
increasingly attention to transparency and sharing of data and model code used for scientific publications
(https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376 ).

{% blocktrans %}
Your publication was included {{ publication_link }}, but we did not find in the article a publicly available location for the source
code of the model that is used for the publication.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}
We hope to learn from you whether the model code is currently publicly available. You could also archive your code
now (see link for recommended public archives). We look forward to your response.

Thanks!

The CoMSES Network Editors
