{% blocktrans %}
We are contacting you regarding your publication {{ publication_title | default: "" }}. As a part of CoMSES Net, a spoke in
the Big Data Network of the U.S. National Science Foundation, we focus on sharing and preserving primarily agent- and individual-based
computational models in our database of publications. This database connects scholars to allow them to find relevant model codes
and build on each other's work. As you may be aware, there is an increasing demand for the transparency and sharing of data and
model codes used for scientific publications (https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376).
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}
Your publication is included in our database, but we did not find in the article a publicly available location for the source
code of the model that is used for the publication.
{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}
We hope to learn from you whether the model code is currently publicly available. You could also archive your code
now (see link for recommended public archives). We look forward to your response.

Thank you,

The CoMSES Network Editors
