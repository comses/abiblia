Dear {{ author_correspondence_log.contact_author_name|default:"CONTACT_AUTHOR_NAME" }},

{{ author_correspondence_log.content }}

We are contacting you regarding your publication '{{ author_correspondence_log.publication.title|default:"PUBLICATION_TITLE" }}'. As a part of CoMSES Net, a spoke in the Big Data Network of the U.S. National Science Foundation, we focus on sharing and preserving primarily agent- and individual-based computational models in our database of publications. This database connects scholars to allow them to find relevant model codes and build on each other's work. As you may be aware, there is an increasing demand for the transparency and sharing of data and model codes used for scientific publications (https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376).

Your publication was included in our database, and we found the article in a publicly available location for the source code of the model that is used for the publication. However, the data was stored on a website that has limited guarantee for permanence of availability. Ideally, you would deposit the code in a public archive (see https://www.comses.net/ for examples). Let us know in case you deposit your code in a public archive so we could update the database.


Thank you,

The CoMSES Network Editors
