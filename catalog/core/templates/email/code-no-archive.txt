I contact you in regard to your publication “ {{ publication_title }}“. I am part of CoMSES Net, a Spoke in the Big Data Network of the US
National Science Foundation, and we focus on sharing and preserving computational models. As part of this we develop
a database of publications on computational models (mainly agent-based and individual-based). This database will allow
scholars to find relevant model code and makes it easier to build on each other’s work. As you may be aware there is
increasingly attention to transparency and sharing of data and model code used for scientific publications
(https://forum.comses.net/t/why-archive-your-model/7376 ).

Your publication was included {{ publication_link }}, and we did found in the article a publicly available location for the
source code of the model that is used for the publication. However, the data was stored on a website
that has limited guarantee for permanence of availability. Ideally you would deposit the code in a public
archive (see {{ comses website link }} for examples). Let us know in case you deposit your code in a public
archive so we could update the database.

Thanks!
