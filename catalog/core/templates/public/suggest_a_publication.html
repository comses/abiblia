            We welcome suggestions for publications which are not within the database. The current database is
            based on search terms agent-based modeling and individual-based modeling. We will keep the database focused
            on those type of computational models, but we recognize that not all relevant publications have those
            keywords. As such you can send suggestions for publications to be included within
            the database.

            Note that you need to be logged in as a comses net member to use this form. Note that at the
            moment we only consider publications which are included within the ISI Web of Science since it allows us to
            use good quality meta data to visualize the publication landscape.

            Please provide enough information to identify the publication (ideally provide a DOI but title
            and journal should also be enough). It will also be helpful if you provide the URL where the model code
            is available.
        </p>

        <p>
            Publication addition requests are evaluated on a periodic basis.
