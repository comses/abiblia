Abstract = {{Objectives. As a case study of the impact of universal versus targeted
   interventions on population health and health inequalities, we used
   simulations to examine (1) whether universal or targeted manipulations
   of collective efficacy better reduced population-level rates and
   racial/ethnic inequalities in violent victimization; and (2) whether
   experiments reduced disparities without addressing fundamental causes.
   Methods. We applied agent-based simulation techniques to the specific
   example of an intervention on neighborhood collective efficacy to reduce
   population-level rates and racial/ethnic inequalities in violent
   victimization. The agent population consisted of 4000 individuals aged
   18 years and older with sociodemographic characteristics assigned to
   match distributions of the adult population in New York City according
   to the 2000 US Census.
   Results. Universal experiments reduced rates of victimization more than
   targeted experiments. However, neither experiment reduced inequalities.
   To reduce inequalities, it was necessary to eliminate racial/ethnic
   residential segregation.
   Conclusions. These simulations support the use of universal intervention
   but suggest that it is not possible to address inequalities in health
   without first addressing fundamental causes.}},
