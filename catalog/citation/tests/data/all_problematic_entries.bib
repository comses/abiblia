Title = {{An integrated framework of agent-based modelling and robust optimization
   for microgrid energy management}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{70-88}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A microgrid energy management framework for the optimization of
   individual objectives of microgrid stakeholders is proposed. The
   framework is exemplified by way of a microgrid that is connected to an
   external grid via a transformer and includes the following players: a
   middle-size train station with integrated photovoltaic power production
   system, a small energy production plant composed of urban wind turbines,
   and a surrounding district including residences and small businesses.
   The system is described by Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), in which each
   player is modelled as an individual agent aiming at a particular goal,
   (i) decreasing its expenses for power purchase or (ii) increasing its
   revenues from power selling. The context in which the agents operate is
   uncertain due to the stochasticity of operational and environmental
   parameters, and the technical failures of the renewable power
   generators. The uncertain operational and environmental parameters of
   the microgrid are quantified in terms of Prediction Intervals (PIs) by a
   Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - trained Neural
   Network (NN). Under these uncertainties, each agent is seeking for
   optimal goal-directed actions planning by Robust Optimization (RO). The
   developed framework is shown to lead to an increase in system
   performance, evaluated in terms of typical reliability (adequacy)
   indicators for energy systems, such as Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE)
   and Loss of Expected Energy (LOEE), in comparison with optimal planning
   based on expected values of the uncertain parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier
