catalog
=======

Provides web tools for annotating and managing bibliographic references for publications that involve computational modeling. Developed by  [CoMSES Net](http://www.openabm.org) to catalog the state of computational model archival. For open, repeatable science! And justice for all.

To build a development environment for the project run `vagrant up`, then ssh into the Vagrant box and run `setup.sh`.
